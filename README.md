# ShopVibe Configuration & API Documentation

ShopVibe is an enterprise-grade full-stack ecommerce application featuring integrated workforce management, role-based access control, and a scalable relational database architecture.

## Architecture & Tech Stack

This repository is structured into a React client and a highly available REST API backend.

- **Frontend:** React.js, Vite
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Database:** MySQL
- **Cloud Hosting:** Render (Frontend/Backend) & Aiven (MySQL)
- **Authentication:** JSON Web Tokens (JWT)

## Live Deployment

This project is fully deployed to the cloud!
- **Frontend:** [Render Static Site](https://render.com)
- **Backend API:** [Render Web Service](https://render.com)
- **Database:** Aiven Free MySQL

To test the live application as an administrator, use:
- **Email:** `admin@ecommerce.com`
- **Password:** `admin123`

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager
- MySQL Server (v8.0+)

## Installation & Setup

### 1. Database Initialization

1. Connect to your local MySQL instance.
2. Execute the provided schema file to construct the application models.
   ```bash
   mysql -u root -p < backend/database/schema.sql
   ```
3. A default administrator account is automatically seeded into the users table.
   - **Email:** `admin@ecommerce.com`
   - **Password:** `admin123`

### 2. Backend Environment

Navigate to the `backend` directory, install necessary dependencies, and supply required configuration parameters.

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in the `backend` root explicitely matching your database configuration. If running the cloud database, use your Aiven credentials:
```env
PORT=5000
DB_HOST=mysql-xxxx-aivencloud.com
DB_PORT=25732
DB_USER=avnadmin
DB_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password
DB_NAME=ecommerce_db
JWT_SECRET=vibgyor_ecommerce_jwt_secret_2026
```

Boot the Node server process:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 3. Frontend Environment

Navigate to the `frontend` workspace to load the client dependencies.

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The localized development client will broadcast to `http://localhost:5173`.

## Database Schema Overview

The `ecommerce_db` layout ensures entity integrity supporting both retail logistics and workforce coordination.

- `users`: Core identity management providing `admin`, `employee`, and `customer` privilege escalation.
- `categories` & `products`: Catalog infrastructure containing soft-deletion directives for referential preservation.
- `cart`, `wishlist` & `orders`: Relational mapping of transactional states and preferences tied to authenticated user IDs.
- `payment`: Financial history bindings supporting order workflows.
- `leave_requests` & `attendance`: Human Resource sub-system storing temporal check-in limits and Paid Time Off (PTO) resolutions.

## System Features

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Middleware-level security enforcement differentiating administrative tasks, staff controls, and general consumer transactions.
- **Workforce Management Toolkit:** Staff-facing shift attendance protocols combined with an HR-approval dashboard for administrative delegates.
- **Inventory Orchestration:** Administrative interfaces dedicated to stock operations involving low-stock signaling and hidden product states.
- **Order Processing Pipeline:** Standardized asynchronous state flow mapping cart assembly out to finalized delivery tracking.
- **Stateless Authentication Protocol:** Decoupled server sessions enforced via encrypted JWT payloads stored securely in local browser APIs.
